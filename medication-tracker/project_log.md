   - Dependency injection setup

### Next Steps
1. Implement unit tests for MedicationReferenceService
2. Set up integration tests with FDA API
3. Update dependent services
4. Add monitoring and metrics

### Migration Status Update
- Phase 2 (Core Infrastructure): 40% complete
  - Base TypeScript setup
  - Database layer migration
  - MedicationReferenceService migration
  - Other service migrations in progress
  - Testing infrastructure setup

## Latest Updates (2024-12-21 12:03)

### Critical Path Analysis
After reviewing the codebase, we've identified the following critical dependencies:

1. Core Medication Safety (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - MedicationReferenceService (TypeScript)
   - MedicationValidationService (Next for migration)
   - DrugInteractionService (Blocked by validation service)
   - MedicationService (Depends on validation and interaction)

2. Patient Safety Features
   - Dosage validation
   - Drug interaction checks
   - Scheduling validation
   - Emergency alerts

3. HIPAA Compliance
   - Audit logging infrastructure
   - Data encryption
   - Access control
   - Medication-specific audit trails
