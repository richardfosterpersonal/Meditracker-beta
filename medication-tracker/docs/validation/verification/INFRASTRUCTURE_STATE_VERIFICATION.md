## Verification Process

### 1. Service State Verification
MUST verify each service:
```markdown
Frontend Service:
- [ ] Container status
- [ ] Resource usage
- [ ] Port availability
- [ ] Health check

Backend Service:
- [ ] Container status
- [ ] Resource usage
- [ ] Port availability
- [ ] Health check

Database Service:
- [ ] Container status
- [ ] Resource usage
- [ ] Connection status
- [ ] Data integrity

Cache Service:
- [ ] Container status
- [ ] Resource usage
- [ ] Connection status
- [ ] Performance check
```

### 2. Resource Verification
MUST check all resources:
```markdown
System Resources:
- [ ] CPU availability
- [ ] Memory usage
- [ ] Disk space
- [ ] Network status

Container Resources:
- [ ] Resource limits
- [ ] Current usage
- [ ] Available capacity
- [ ] Performance metrics
```

### 3. Configuration Verification
MUST validate configurations:
```markdown
Docker Configuration:
- [ ] Compose file
- [ ] Environment variables
- [ ] Network setup
- [ ] Volume mounts

Service Configuration:
- [ ] Environment settings
- [ ] Connection strings
- [ ] Security settings
- [ ] Resource limits
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Initial Checks
```markdown
Status: PENDING
Steps:
1. [ ] Verify service processes
2. [ ] Check resource availability
3. [ ] Validate configurations
4. [ ] Test connections
```

### 2. Detailed Verification
```markdown
Status: PENDING
Steps:
1. [ ] Service health checks
2. [ ] Resource monitoring
3. [ ] Configuration validation
4. [ ] Performance testing
```

### 3. Documentation
```markdown
Status: PENDING
Required:
1. [ ] Verification results
2. [ ] Resource metrics
3. [ ] Configuration status
4. [ ] Health check logs
```

## Critical Path Alignment

### 1. Safety Requirements
VERIFY:
- [ ] Core functionality preserved
- [ ] Data protection active
- [ ] Error handling operational
- [ ] Monitoring active

### 2. Security Requirements
ENSURE:
- [ ] Access controls active
- [ ] Encryption enabled
- [ ] Audit logging operational
- [ ] Compliance maintained

### 3. Performance Requirements
CHECK:
- [ ] Response times
- [ ] Resource efficiency
- [ ] Error rates
- [ ] System stability

This verification must be completed before proceeding with container validation.
