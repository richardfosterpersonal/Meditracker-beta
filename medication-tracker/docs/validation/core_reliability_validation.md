Last Updated: 2024-12-25T23:12:26+01:00
Status: BETA-CRITICAL

## Core Reliability Features

### 1. Data Persistence
- [x] Basic CRUD operations
- [x] Transaction support
- [x] Data backups
- [ ] Advanced replication (post-beta)

### 2. Error Handling
- [x] Basic error recovery
- [x] Error logging
- [x] User notifications
- [ ] Advanced error prediction (post-beta)

### 3. State Management
- [x] Basic state tracking
- [x] Consistency checks
- [x] State recovery
- [ ] Advanced state analysis (post-beta)

### 4. System Monitoring
- [x] Basic health checks
- [x] Performance monitoring
- [x] Alert system
- [ ] Advanced diagnostics (post-beta)

## Validation Evidence

### Data Operations
```python
def test_basic_persistence():
    assert save_medication_record("test_med") == "SAVED"
    assert retrieve_medication_record("test_med") != None
```

### Error Recovery
```python
def test_error_handling():
    assert handle_connection_error() == "RECOVERED"
    assert verify_error_logs() == "ACTIVE"
```

### State Checks
```python
def test_state_management():
    assert verify_system_state() == "CONSISTENT"
    assert recover_from_crash() == "SUCCESSFUL"
```

## Test Results
- Core Data Tests: PASSED
- Error Handling Tests: PASSED
- State Management Tests: PASSED
- Basic Monitoring: PASSED

## Beta Requirements
- [x] Basic data operations verified
- [x] Core error handling active
- [x] State management functional
- [x] Basic monitoring operational

## Deferred to Post-Beta
1. Advanced replication
2. Predictive error handling
3. Complex state analysis
4. Advanced monitoring systems
