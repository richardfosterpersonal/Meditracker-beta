  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node dist/index.js",
    "dev": "node --loader ts-node/esm --experimental-specifier-resolution=node src/index.ts"
  }
}
```

2. Check existing codebase
3. Review project logs
4. Examine test coverage
5. Verify feature registry
```

### 3. Documentation Cross-Reference
```
MANDATORY CHECKS:
1. README.md
2. DEVELOPMENT.md
3. project_log.md
4. Current validation reports
5. Migration status
```

### 4. Change Impact Analysis
```
REQUIRED VALIDATION:
1. Does this duplicate existing work?
2. Will this conflict with current features?
3. Is this aligned with migration goals?
4. Have all dependencies been checked?
5. Is there clear evidence this is needed?
```
