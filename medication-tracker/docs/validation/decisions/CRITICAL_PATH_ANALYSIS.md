# Critical Path Analysis
Last Updated: 2024-12-25T20:48:29+01:00
Status: CRITICAL
Reference: ../critical_path/MASTER_CRITICAL_PATH.md

## Core Application Requirements

### 1. Medication Safety (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
```markdown
Status: CRITICAL

Required Components:
! Error Reporting
  - Immediate medication errors
  - Schedule conflicts
  - Dosage warnings
  - User notifications

Rationale:
This directly impacts patient safety and is non-negotiable.
```

### 2. Data Integrity (HIGH PRIORITY)
```markdown
Status: CRITICAL

Required Components:
! Monitoring
  - Data consistency
  - Transaction validation
  - State verification
  - Recovery procedures

Rationale:
Essential for maintaining accurate medical records.
```

### 3. User Safety (HIGH PRIORITY)
```markdown
Status: CRITICAL

Required Components:
! Enhanced Error Reporting
  - Clear user feedback
  - Action validation
  - Safety warnings
  - Recovery guidance

Rationale:
Critical for preventing medication errors.
```

## Analysis of Proposed Options

### 1. Admin Interface Tests
```markdown
Status: OPTIONAL

Assessment:
- Not directly related to medication safety
- Administrative functionality only
- Can be implemented later
× NOT on critical path
```

### 2. Monitoring Endpoints
```markdown
Status: CRITICAL

Assessment:
- Essential for data integrity
- Enables early error detection
- Supports system stability
✓ Required for critical path
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Reporting
```markdown
Status: CRITICAL

Assessment:
- Direct impact on user safety
- Critical for medication safety
- Essential for error prevention
✓ Required for critical path
```

## Implementation Priority

### 1. Enhanced Error Reporting (IMMEDIATE)
```markdown
Rationale:
- Directly impacts medication safety
- Essential for user guidance
- Prevents critical errors
- Supports core functionality

Implementation:
1. User-facing error messages
2. Validation feedback
3. Safety warnings
4. Recovery procedures
```

### 2. Monitoring Endpoints (HIGH)
```markdown
Rationale:
- Ensures data integrity
- Enables proactive intervention
- Supports system stability
- Maintains safety records

Implementation:
1. Data consistency checks
2. Transaction monitoring
3. State validation
4. Recovery protocols
```

### 3. Admin Interface Tests (DEFER)
```markdown
Rationale:
- Administrative function only
- Not safety-critical
- Can be implemented later
- No direct user impact

Status: Defer to later phase
```

## Decision

Based on critical path analysis:

1. IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY:
   - Enhanced Error Reporting
   - Monitoring Endpoints

2. DEFER:
   - Admin Interface Tests

This prioritization ensures we focus on components that directly impact:
- Medication safety
- Data integrity
- User safety

These are the core requirements of our medical tracking application.
