Status: CRITICAL
Reference: ../critical_path/MASTER_CRITICAL_PATH.md

## Decision Context

### 1. Validation Dashboard Purpose
```markdown
Status: INTERNAL_ONLY

Primary Users:
- Developers
- System Administrators
- Quality Assurance Team

NOT Intended For:
× End Users
× Patients
× Healthcare Providers
```

### 2. Rationale
```markdown
1. Technical Nature
   - Contains implementation details
   - Shows system internals
   - Exposes validation states

2. Security Considerations
   - Could expose system architecture
   - Reveals file structures
   - Shows internal processes

3. User Experience
   - Not relevant to end users
   - Could cause confusion
   - Distracts from core functionality
```

## Implementation Decision

### 1. Access Control
```markdown
Status: RESTRICTED

Access Levels:
✓ Development environment only
✓ Protected routes
✓ Admin authentication required
```

### 2. Environment Separation
```markdown
Status: ENFORCED

Visibility Rules:
1. Development
   ✓ Full dashboard access
   ✓ Real-time updates
   ✓ Complete details

2. Staging
   ✓ Limited dashboard access
   ✓ Authentication required
   ✓ Filtered information

3. Production
   × No dashboard access
   × No validation display
   × No technical details
```

### 3. User-Facing Validation
```markdown
Status: IMPLEMENTED

What Users Should See:
✓ Input validation feedback
✓ Error messages (user-friendly)
✓ Success confirmations
✓ Loading states

What Users Should NOT See:
× System validation status
× File references
× Technical details
× Implementation specifics
```

## Critical Path Integration

### 1. User Safety
```markdown
Status: MAINTAINED

Visible to Users:
✓ Medication safety warnings
✓ Schedule conflict alerts
✓ Input validation feedback
✓ Error recovery guidance

Hidden from Users:
× System validation states
× Technical error details
× File validation status
× Implementation checks
```

### 2. Data Safety
```markdown
Status: MAINTAINED

Visible to Users:
✓ Data input validation
✓ Save/update confirmations
✓ Error notifications
✓ Recovery options

Hidden from Users:
× Database validation
× File integrity checks
× System health status
× Technical diagnostics
```

### 3. System Safety
```markdown
Status: MAINTAINED

Visible to Users:
✓ Service availability
✓ Operation success/failure
✓ Recovery instructions
✓ Status updates

Hidden from Users:
× System diagnostics
× Technical metrics
× Implementation details
× Validation chain status
```

## Implementation Updates Required

### 1. Immediate Actions
```markdown
Priority: HIGH

Required Changes:
1. Move validation dashboard to admin route
2. Add authentication protection
3. Remove from main app layout
4. Update environment configs
```

### 2. Development Tools
```markdown
Priority: MEDIUM

Updates Needed:
1. Create separate admin interface
2. Add development-only routes
3. Update access controls
4. Enhance security checks
```

This document establishes that the validation dashboard is strictly for development and maintenance purposes, not for end users.
