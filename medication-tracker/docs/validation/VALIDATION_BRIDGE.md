## Purpose
Bridge core validation processes with continuity guards to prevent validation chain breaks.

## Process Integration

### 1. Core Process to Guard Bridge
ENSURE alignment between:
- Core validation requirements
- Continuity guard checks
- State verification
- Chain maintenance

### 2. Validation Chain Protection
IMPLEMENT guards for:
```markdown
1. State Changes
   - [ ] Pre-change validation
   - [ ] State documentation
   - [ ] Change verification
   - [ ] Post-change validation

2. Service Operations
   - [ ] Service state checks
   - [ ] Dependency validation
   - [ ] Resource verification
   - [ ] Operation logging

3. Infrastructure Changes
   - [ ] Configuration validation
   - [ ] Resource verification
   - [ ] Security checks
   - [ ] Change documentation
```

### 3. Break Prevention
MAINTAIN through:
1. Automated checks
2. State monitoring
3. Chain verification
4. Documentation updates

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Process Application
FOLLOW for all operations:
1. Check core process requirements
2. Apply continuity guards
3. Verify chain integrity
4. Document state changes

### 2. State Management
MAINTAIN at all times:
- Current state documentation
- Change history
- Validation evidence
- Chain continuity

### 3. Recovery Integration
IMPLEMENT recovery through:
1. Break detection
2. State verification
3. Chain restoration
4. Process improvement

This bridge ensures seamless integration between core processes and continuity guards.
