## Overview
This document serves as the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the entire Medication Tracker application's critical path. All other documentation and implementation must align with this master document.

## Core Mission
To provide a secure, reliable medication tracking system that ensures patient safety through accurate scheduling, interaction checking, and proper security measures.
