# Validation Migration Plan
Date: 2024-12-24

## Purpose
Consolidate all validation processes into a single source of truth aligned with critical path and beta requirements.

## Current Issues

### 1. Documentation Fragmentation
- Multiple validation files
- Overlapping content
- Unclear hierarchy

### 2. Critical Path Misalignment
- Validation not explicitly tied to critical components
- Focus on technical rather than business requirements
- Security and monitoring validations scattered

### 3. Process Inefficiency
- Redundant validations
- Unclear priorities
- Resource waste

## Migration Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions (24-48 hours)

#### Documentation Consolidation
- [ ] Move all validation content to SINGLE_SOURCE_VALIDATION.md
- [ ] Archive old validation files
- [ ] Update all references

#### Process Alignment
- [ ] Map validations to critical path
- [ ] Prioritize based on beta requirements
- [ ] Update validation procedures

#### Evidence Migration
- [ ] Move evidence to new structure
- [ ] Update naming convention
- [ ] Verify completeness

### 2. Short Term (1 week)

#### Team Training
- [ ] New validation process
- [ ] Evidence requirements
- [ ] Sign-off procedures

#### Process Updates
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Testing procedures
- [ ] Documentation templates

#### Validation Backlog
- [ ] Review existing validations
- [ ] Identify gaps
- [ ] Create action items

### 3. Long Term (2-4 weeks)

#### Process Optimization
- [ ] Automate where possible
- [ ] Streamline procedures
- [ ] Reduce overhead

#### Compliance Verification
- [ ] Audit trail completion
- [ ] Regulatory compliance
- [ ] Documentation completeness

#### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Validation efficiency
- [ ] Resource utilization
- [ ] Quality metrics

## Files to Archive

1. /validation/CORE_VALIDATION_PROCESS.md
2. /validation/container_build_validation.md
3. /validation/2024-12-24_comprehensive_validation.md
4. /validation/2024-12-24_environment_validation.md

## New Structure

```
/validation/
├── SINGLE_SOURCE_VALIDATION.md
├── evidence/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD_[component]_[type].md
└── templates/
    └── validation_evidence_template.md
```
