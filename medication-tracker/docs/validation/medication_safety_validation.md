# Medication Safety Validation
Last Updated: 2024-12-25T23:12:26+01:00
Status: BETA-CRITICAL

## Core Safety Features

### 1. Drug Interaction Validation
- [x] Basic drug-drug interaction checks
- [x] Common interaction database integration
- [x] Critical interaction alerts
- [ ] Advanced interaction analysis (post-beta)

### 2. Dosage Verification
- [x] Basic dose range checks
- [x] Age-based dosing rules
- [x] Weight-based calculations
- [ ] Complex dosing schedules (post-beta)

### 3. Emergency Protocols
- [x] Critical alert system
- [x] Emergency contact integration
- [x] Basic incident logging
- [ ] Advanced emergency response (post-beta)

### 4. Allergy Verification
- [x] Basic allergy checks
- [x] Common allergen database
- [x] Alert generation
- [ ] Complex allergy interactions (post-beta)

## Validation Evidence

### Drug Safety
```python
def test_basic_drug_interaction():
    assert check_interaction("aspirin", "warfarin") == "HIGH_RISK"
    assert check_interaction("tylenol", "advil") == "MODERATE_RISK"
```

### Dosage Safety
```python
def test_basic_dosage():
    assert verify_dose("tylenol", 500, "adult") == "SAFE"
    assert verify_dose("aspirin", 1000, "child") == "UNSAFE"
```

### Emergency System
```python
def test_emergency_alerts():
    assert trigger_emergency("CRITICAL_INTERACTION") == "ALERT_SENT"
    assert log_incident("OVERDOSE_RISK") == "LOGGED"
```

## Test Results
- Basic Safety Tests: PASSED
- Core Interaction Tests: PASSED
- Essential Alerts: PASSED
- Basic Logging: PASSED

## Beta Requirements
- [x] Core safety features implemented
- [x] Basic validation tests passing
- [x] Critical alerts functional
- [x] Essential logging active

## Deferred to Post-Beta
1. Advanced interaction analysis
2. Complex dosing schedules
3. Enhanced emergency responses
4. Machine learning predictions
