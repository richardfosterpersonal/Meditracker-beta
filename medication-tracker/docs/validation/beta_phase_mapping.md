# Beta Phase Mapping Validation
Last Updated: 2024-12-31T17:46:35+01:00
Status: Active
Validation ID: VALIDATION-BETA-001

## Overview
This document defines and validates the mapping between critical path phases and beta testing phases.

## Phase Mapping Definition
```
ONBOARDING      -> internal   (Initial system validation)
CORE_FEATURES   -> internal   (Core functionality validation)
DATA_SAFETY     -> limited    (Security and compliance validation)
USER_EXPERIENCE -> open       (User interaction validation)
```

## Validation Requirements

### 1. Phase Sequence Validation
- [x] Phases must be completed in order
- [x] Each phase must validate its prerequisites
- [x] Phase transitions must maintain state consistency

### 2. Evidence Requirements
Each phase requires specific evidence:

#### Internal Phase (ONBOARDING, CORE_FEATURES)
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Integration test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Performance metrics within threshold
- [ ] Security scan results
Reference: VALIDATION-MED-001, VALIDATION-SEC-001

#### Limited Phase (DATA_SAFETY)
- [ ] HIPAA compliance verification
- [ ] Data encryption validation
- [ ] Access control testing
- [ ] Audit logging verification
Reference: VALIDATION-SEC-002, VALIDATION-SEC-003

#### Open Phase (USER_EXPERIENCE)
- [ ] User feedback analysis
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Stability metrics
- [ ] Security audit results
Reference: VALIDATION-SYS-001, VALIDATION-SYS-002

## Validation Process
1. Phase requirements must be validated before transition
2. Evidence must be collected and verified
3. State changes must be atomic and consistent
4. All transitions must be logged and auditable
