Last Updated: 2024-12-24T22:20:21+01:00

## Pre-Validation Checklist

### 1. Environment Requirements
- [x] HIPAA compliance requirements identified
- [x] Security validation requirements documented
- [x] Environment-specific configurations validated

### 2. Test Coverage Requirements
- [x] Medication safety validation points identified
- [x] Security validation points documented
- [x] Evidence collection requirements specified
- [x] Monitoring requirements defined

### 3. Dependencies
- [x] ValidationOrchestrator availability confirmed
- [x] EvidenceCollector integration verified
- [x] Security services validated
- [x] Monitoring services confirmed

### 4. Critical Path Alignment
- [x] Medication safety tests aligned with requirements
- [x] Security tests meet HIPAA standards

- [x] Monitoring aligns with alert requirements

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Test Categories
Each test MUST validate:
- Medication safety (HIGHEST priority)
- Data security (HIGH priority)
- Evidence collection (HIGH priority)
- Monitoring (MEDIUM priority)

### 2. Validation Chain
All tests MUST:
- Maintain validation chain integrity
- Document evidence collection
- Verify security compliance
- Validate monitoring alerts

### 3. Environment-Specific Requirements
Tests MUST validate:
- HIPAA compliance in all data operations
- PHI protection in all logging
- Audit trail completeness
- Access control enforcement
