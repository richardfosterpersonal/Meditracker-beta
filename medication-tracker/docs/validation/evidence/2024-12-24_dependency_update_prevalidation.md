# Dependency Update Pre-validation
Date: 2024-12-24
Time: 14:56
Type: Pre-validation Analysis
Status: Blocked

## Core Process Compliance
âœ“ Following [Core Validation Process](../CORE_VALIDATION_PROCESS.md)

## Pre-validation Findings

### 1. Dependency Conflicts Identified

#### Critical Conflict
```
@testing-library/react-hooks@8.0.1 requires @types/react@"^16.9.0 || ^17.0.0"
BUT
Current project uses @types/react@18.3.12
```

#### Affected Dependencies
1. @mui/base@5.0.0-beta.13
2. @mui/material@5.14.7
3. @mui/icons-material@5.14.18
4. @mui/lab@5.0.0-alpha.153
5. react-bootstrap@2.10.6
6. react-redux@8.1.3

### 2. Risk Assessment

#### High Risk Areas
1. Testing Framework Compatibility
   - @testing-library/react-hooks may not work with React 18
   - Test suite could become unstable
   - CI/CD pipeline may fail

2. Component Library Dependencies
   - Multiple MUI packages affected
   - Potential UI rendering issues
   - Component functionality risks

### 3. Required Actions Before Update

1. Testing Framework Update
   - [ ] Research @testing-library/react-hooks compatibility with React 18
   - [ ] Identify alternative testing approaches if needed
   - [ ] Plan test suite migration

2. Package Version Analysis
   - [ ] Check @testing-library/react-hooks changelog
   - [ ] Verify React 18 compatibility
   - [ ] Review breaking changes

3. Test Environment Setup
   - [ ] Create isolated test environment
   - [ ] Set up version compatibility tests
   - [ ] Prepare rollback procedures

### 4. Update Strategy Options

#### Option 1: Downgrade @types/react
- Pros: Maintains testing library compatibility
- Cons: Loses React 18 type benefits
- Risk: High (affects many dependencies)

#### Option 2: Update Testing Library
- Pros: Maintains React 18 compatibility
- Cons: May require test rewrites
- Risk: Medium (contained to tests)

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. Temporarily use --legacy-peer-deps
2. Create migration plan for tests
3. Gradually update affected packages

## Recommended Approach

1. **HOLD ALL UPDATES** until:
   - Test suite migration plan is created
   - Component library compatibility is verified
   - Rollback procedure is documented

2. Create separate validation track for:
   - Testing framework updates
   - Security patches
   - Dependency resolution

## Required Sign-offs Before Proceeding
- [ ] Technical Lead: Review strategy
- [ ] Testing Lead: Approve test migration
- [ ] Security Officer: Assess risks
- [ ] QA Lead: Verify approach

## Next Steps

1. Document current working state
2. Create test migration plan
3. Set up isolation testing
4. Prepare rollback procedures
5. Schedule staged updates

## Evidence Collection
- [x] Dependency tree analysis
- [x] Conflict identification
- [x] Risk assessment
- [ ] Migration plan
- [ ] Test coverage analysis
