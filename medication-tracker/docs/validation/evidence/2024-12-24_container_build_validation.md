# Container Build Validation Evidence
Date: 2024-12-24
Type: Build Validation
Status: In Progress

## Pre-Build Validation

### 1. Dependency Check Results

#### Frontend
```
npm audit results:
- Total issues: 11
- Moderate: 5
- High: 6
- Critical: 0

Deprecated packages:
- eslint@8.57.1
- glob@7.2.3
- workbox-cacheable-response@6.6.0
- domexception@2.0.1
```

#### Backend
```
pip check results:
- Dependencies to be checked
- Version compatibility to be verified
- Security vulnerabilities to be scanned
```

### 2. Configuration Validation
- [ ] Dockerfile syntax validated
- [ ] Environment variables checked
- [ ] Service dependencies verified
- [ ] Health checks confirmed
- [ ] Resource limits set

### 3. Security Configuration
- [ ] Container user permissions
- [ ] Network security settings
- [ ] Secret management
- [ ] File permissions
- [ ] Security headers

## Build Process Validation

### 1. Image Build
- [ ] Base images verified
- [ ] Build arguments checked
- [ ] Layer caching optimized
- [ ] Image size analyzed
- [ ] Security scan completed

### 2. Container Runtime
- [ ] Service startup order
- [ ] Inter-service communication
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Logging configuration
- [ ] Error handling

## Required Actions

### 1. Frontend
1. Update deprecated packages
2. Fix security vulnerabilities
3. Optimize build process
4. Update dependency versions

### 2. Backend
1. Validate dependencies
2. Check startup configuration
3. Verify service connections
4. Test error handling

### 3. Infrastructure
1. Verify resource limits
2. Check network configuration
3. Validate monitoring setup
4. Test backup procedures

## Sign-off Requirements

### Technical Review
- [ ] Lead Developer
- [ ] Security Engineer
- [ ] DevOps Engineer

### Business Review
- [ ] Product Owner
- [ ] Operations Manager

## Notes
- Initial validation revealed missing container build validation process
- Created new validation documentation
- Updated existing processes to include container validation
- Implementation of fixes pending validation completion
