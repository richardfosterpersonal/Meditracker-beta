Last Updated: 2024-12-24T16:16:30+01:00
Status: In Progress
Reference: SINGLE_SOURCE_VALIDATION.md

## Critical Path Alignment
This implementation supports:
1. Medication Safety (HIGHEST)
   - User access control
   - Feature management
   - Safety validation
2. Data Security (HIGH)
   - HIPAA compliance
   - PHI protection
   - Access logging
3. Core Infrastructure (HIGH)
   - System reliability
   - Feature management
   - Evidence collection

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Framework
1. Beta User Service
   - Feature flag system
   - Access control
   - Evidence collection
2. Validation Integration
   - Critical path checks
   - Evidence tracking
   - Audit logging

### Phase 2: Feature Management
1. A/B Testing System
   - Feature groups
   - Usage tracking
   - Performance metrics
2. Analytics Integration
   - Usage patterns
   - Error tracking
   - Performance data

### Phase 3: Security Enhancement
1. Access Control
   - Role-based access
   - Feature permissions
   - Audit trails
2. Monitoring
   - Usage tracking
   - Error detection
   - Performance metrics

## Validation Requirements

### 1. Feature Access
- Must validate user level
- Must check feature status
- Must log access attempts
- Must collect evidence

### 2. Data Protection
- Must verify HIPAA compliance
- Must protect PHI
- Must maintain audit trail
- Must track usage

### 3. Monitoring
- Must track feature usage
- Must monitor errors
- Must collect feedback
- Must generate reports

## Evidence Collection
All validation evidence will be stored in:
/logs/validation/beta_users/
  ├── access_logs/
  ├── feature_usage/
  ├── performance_metrics/
  └── audit_trails/
