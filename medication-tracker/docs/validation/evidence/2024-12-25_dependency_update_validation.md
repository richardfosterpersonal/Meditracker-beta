# Dependency Update Validation
Last Updated: 2024-12-25T22:07:16+01:00

## Overview
This document outlines the validation process for updating critical dependencies while maintaining system integrity and compliance.

## Dependencies Being Updated
1. cryptography (41.0.7 -> 44.0.0)
2. SQLAlchemy (2.0.23 -> 2.0.27)
3. Flask-JWT-Extended (4.5.2 -> 4.6.0)
4. pydantic-settings (new requirement)

## Critical Path Alignment

### 1. Medication Safety (HIGHEST)
- [ ] Drug interaction validation still functional
- [ ] Real-time safety alerts operational
- [ ] Emergency protocols intact
- [ ] Monitoring integration maintained

### 2. Data Security (HIGH)
- [ ] HIPAA compliance verified
- [ ] PHI protection enhanced
- [ ] Audit trails functional
- [ ] Access controls validated

### 3. Core Infrastructure (HIGH)
- [ ] System reliability tested
- [ ] Performance metrics collected
- [ ] High availability confirmed
- [ ] Backup systems operational

## Validation Steps

### Pre-Update
1. [x] Create secure backup
2. [x] Document current state
3. [x] Verify monitoring systems
4. [x] Check critical path alignment

### During Update
1. [x] Update cryptography package
2. [x] Update SQLAlchemy
3. [x] Update Flask-JWT-Extended
4. [ ] Add pydantic-settings
5. [ ] Run validation tests
6. [ ] Collect performance metrics

### Post-Update
1. [ ] Verify all critical path components
2. [ ] Check security measures
3. [ ] Validate monitoring systems
4. [ ] Document evidence
5. [ ] Update documentation

## Evidence Collection

### Security Evidence
- [ ] Encryption validation results
- [ ] Access control tests
- [ ] PHI protection verification
- [ ] Audit log validation

### Performance Evidence
- [ ] Response time measurements
- [ ] Resource utilization stats
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] System stability metrics

### Compliance Evidence
- [ ] HIPAA compliance checks
- [ ] Data protection validation
- [ ] Privacy control verification
- [ ] Regulatory requirement tests

## Sign-offs Required
1. [ ] Security Lead
2. [ ] Compliance Officer
3. [ ] System Architect
4. [ ] Quality Assurance
