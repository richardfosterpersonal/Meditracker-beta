- [ ] Data isolation
- [ ] Access logging
- [ ] Data retention

### 3. Feature Management (HIGH)
- [ ] Feature flag system
- [ ] A/B testing capability
- [ ] Usage tracking
- [ ] Feedback collection

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Framework
1. Beta user model
2. Access control system
3. Feature flag system
4. Validation hooks
