# Beta Phase Critical Path
Last Updated: 2024-12-30T21:32:54.793334

## Essential Components for Beta

### 1. Medication Safety (CRITICAL)
Required validation:
- Drug interaction validation
- Dosage verification
- Emergency protocols
- Basic allergy checks

### 2. Data Security (CRITICAL)
Required validation:
- HIPAA compliance
- Data encryption
- Access control
- Audit logging

### 3. Core Reliability (CRITICAL)
Required validation:
- Data persistence
- Error handling
- State management
- Basic monitoring

### Non-Critical for Beta
The following can be validated post-beta:
- Advanced analytics
- Enhanced monitoring
- Optimization features
- Beta scaling
- Service migration
- Advanced automation

## Validation Requirements

Only the following validation documents are required for beta:

1. `/docs/validation/medication_safety_validation.md`
   - Core medication safety features
   - Basic drug interaction checks
   - Required for patient safety

2. `/docs/validation/security_validation.md`
   - Basic HIPAA compliance
   - Essential data protection
   - Required for legal compliance

3. `/docs/validation/core_reliability_validation.md`
   - Data integrity
   - System stability
   - Required for basic operation

## Scope Management

### What to Include
- Core medication safety features
- Basic security measures
- Essential reliability components

### What to Defer
- Advanced features
- Optimizations
- Non-essential integrations
- Enhanced monitoring
- Complex analytics

## Validation Process

1. Focus validation efforts on:
   - Patient safety features
   - Data security
   - System stability

2. Defer validation for:
   - Performance optimizations
   - Advanced features
   - Non-critical enhancements

3. Document only what's necessary:
   - Core functionality validation
   - Security compliance
   - Basic reliability tests

## Next Steps

1. Create essential validation documents
2. Validate core safety features
3. Verify security compliance
4. Test basic reliability
5. Move to beta when these are complete

Remember: Any feature not directly supporting medication safety, security, or basic reliability should be deferred to post-beta phases.
