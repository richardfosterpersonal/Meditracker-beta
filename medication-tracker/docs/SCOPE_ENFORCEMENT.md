# Scope Enforcement Guidelines
Last Updated: 2024-12-25T22:50:11+01:00

## Purpose
This document establishes mandatory guidelines to prevent scope creep and maintain focus on critical path requirements.

## Critical Path Verification Checklist
Before any new code changes or feature additions, verify:

### 1. Core Requirements Alignment
- [ ] Does this change directly support medication safety?
- [ ] Does this change maintain or enhance HIPAA compliance?
- [ ] Does this change improve system reliability?
- [ ] Is this change part of the MUST HAVE features in SCOPE.md?

### 2. Dependency Impact
- [ ] Are new dependencies absolutely necessary for core functionality?
- [ ] Do new dependencies comply with DEPENDENCY_GUIDELINES.md?
- [ ] Has the security impact been assessed?

### 3. Complexity Assessment
- [ ] Is this the simplest possible implementation?
- [ ] Does this change introduce new services that aren't critical path?
- [ ] Can this functionality be achieved with existing components?

### 4. Documentation Requirements
Before implementing any change:
1. Update CRITICAL_PATH.md to reflect the change
2. Update SCOPE.md if scope is affected
3. Document validation requirements in validation/
4. Create validation evidence in validation_evidence/

## Enforcement Process
1. All PRs must include completed Critical Path Verification Checklist
2. Changes that introduce non-critical features must be tagged as "scope-extension"
3. "scope-extension" changes require explicit approval from project lead
4. Regular scope audits must be performed using sonar-scope-check.py

## Scope Creep Prevention
1. Maintain single responsibility principle
2. Avoid premature optimization
3. Focus on core medication safety features
4. Defer non-critical enhancements to future phases

## Current Critical Path Components
1. Medication Safety
   - Drug interaction validation
   - Safety alerts
   - Emergency protocols
   - Dosage validation

2. Data Security
   - HIPAA compliance
   - PHI protection
   - Audit logging

3. Core Infrastructure
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Basic monitoring

## Out of Scope Features (Current Phase)
1. Advanced caching mechanisms
2. Complex notification systems
3. Real-time collaboration
4. Advanced analytics
5. Custom dashboards
6. External integrations (except FDA database)

## Enforcement Tools
1. sonar-scope-check.py - Automated scope compliance checker
2. validation-enforcer.py - Validation requirement checker
3. dependency-validator.py - Dependency compliance checker
