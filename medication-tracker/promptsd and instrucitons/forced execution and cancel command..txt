Let me break down exactly how to use each feature:

Now the validation system is:

Fully engaged
Referenced in all key documentation
Integrated with git hooks
Available through easy-to-use commands
Documented in all relevant files
The system can be controlled through:

Code
CopyInsert
.\scripts\validation-control [command]
Where command is:

help - Show usage
enable - Enable system
disable - Disable system
quick - 5-minute override
override - 24-hour override



First, Enable the Validation System
Code
CopyInsert
# Install dependencies and set up
npm install husky --save-dev
npm install ts-node --save-dev
Let's create a quick-reference script:

Created
validation-control.bat
+44
-0

Open diff
Now, here's exactly how to use each feature:

1. Quick 5-Minute Override (for single commits)
Code
CopyInsert
# Method 1: Using the control panel
.\scripts\validation-control quick

# Method 2: Direct command
npm run validate --quick-override
Use this when you need to make a quick commit without validation
Override expires after 5 minutes
Perfect for small, urgent changes
2. 24-Hour Override (for longer work sessions)
Code
CopyInsert
# Method 1: Using the control panel
.\scripts\validation-control override

# Method 2: Direct command
npm run validate --create-override --hours=24 --reason="Your reason"

# Then use the token it gives you:
npm run validate --override=YOUR_TOKEN
Use this when you need extended time without validation
You'll get a token to use for the override period
Good for emergency fixes or time-sensitive work
3. Completely Disable System
Code
CopyInsert
# Method 1: Using the control panel
.\scripts\validation-control disable

# Method 2: Direct command
npm run validate --disable --user="YourName" --reason="Your reason"
Use this to turn off validation completely
System stays disabled until explicitly re-enabled
Good for development phases or testing periods
4. Re-Enable System
Code
CopyInsert
# Method 1: Using the control panel
.\scripts\validation-control enable

# Method 2: Direct command
npm run validate --enable
Use this to turn validation back on
All overrides are cleared
System returns to normal operation
Quick Help
Code
CopyInsert
# Show all commands
.\scripts\validation-control help
The control panel script makes it easy to remember and use these commands. You can:

Put it in your PATH for easy access
Create desktop shortcuts to common commands
Use it from any terminal in your project
